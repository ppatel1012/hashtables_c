My hashing algorithm uses a bitwse operation XOR (Exclusive OR) which comapres 
the current value of hash with the current element in the key which should produce a 
unique hash. Then the hash is modulus with the size to ensure it fits in the range.
Not all hash values produced will be unique however the number of collisions are less then hash by length and by sum.
